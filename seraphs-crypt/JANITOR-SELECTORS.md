# JanitorAI selector map

What can actually be targeted on a JanitorAI profile page, and how.

Observed from working community templates (Hime, `@yourhighness08`) rather than
official docs. None of this is documented by JanitorAI, so it can break on any
redeploy. Class *names* are facts about the platform, not anyone's design — the
techniques below are noted so the crypt can use them without copying anyone's
stylesheet.

Most of the map below is read off Hime's **Dark Red** template, which she
released free for public use and modification. Credit where it is due: without
it, half of these selectors would still be guesswork. Her rule is the sensible
one — take the ideas, don't take a layout wholesale and call it yours.

## Two kinds of class name

**Semantic, stable — use these.** They read like names a developer chose, and
they survive redeploys:

| Selector | What it is |
|---|---|
| `.pp-uc-about-me` | the container your About Me paste lands in |
| `.pp-uc-avatar` | profile picture |
| `.pp-uc-title` | the username heading |
| `.pp-uc-background` | the bio card's background panel |
| `.profile-info-stack` | outer column holding the whole profile block |
| `.profile-info-hstack` | row holding avatar + name |
| `.profile-page-flex` | wrapper around bio *and* the bot card list |
| `.profile-background-effect-image` | the blurred backdrop image |

**Hashed, unstable — avoid.** Emotion/CSS-in-JS output like `.css-15w88gn`,
`.css-1q7rmf0`. The hash is regenerated whenever the site is rebuilt, so a rule
written against one works until it silently doesn't.

When there is no semantic class, match on a substring instead:

```css
[class*="contentWrapper"]   /* survives .css-1abc-contentWrapper-xyz */
[class*="wrapper"]
```

Only the hash changes; the readable part usually stays.

**Not real:** `.character-card__name`, `.character-card__wrapper` and the rest
of the `.character-card__*` family. JanitorAI does not ship those. Our
`profile-css.txt` is built almost entirely on them, which is why it appears to
do nothing — see PASTE-HERE.md. The real bot-card names are all `pp-cc-*`,
listed below.

## The bot cards

The part `profile-css.txt` was guessing at. These are real.

| Selector | What it is |
|---|---|
| `.profile-character-card-stack` | the card itself — make this the grid |
| `.pp-cc-wrapper` | outer wrapper, the hook for per-card variants |
| `.pp-cc-name` | character name |
| `.pp-cc-avatar` | the portrait |
| `.profile-character-card-avatar-aspect-ratio` | portrait's aspect box |
| `.pp-cc-description` | the blurb |
| `.profile-character-card-description-box` | blurb's container |
| `.pp-cc-tags`, `.pp-cc-tags-wrap` | tag row and its pills |
| `.pp-cc-tags-regular`, `.pp-tag-<tagname>` | one class per tag, lowercased |
| `.pp-cc-chats-count`, `.pp-cc-public-chats-count` | the counts |
| `.profile-character-card-stats-box` | stats cluster |
| `.pp-cc-ribbon`, `.pp-cc-ribbon-wrap` | the corner ribbon |
| `.pp-cc-creator-name`, `.pp-cc-star-line` | usually hidden on a themed profile |

**The article-card layout** is a grid on the card with named areas — portrait
left, name across the top, blurb and tags right, a series label along the foot:

```css
.profile-character-card-stack {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-areas:
    "name  name"
    "pfp   desc"
    "pfp   tags"
    "serie serie";
}
.pp-cc-name { grid-area: name; }
.profile-character-card-avatar-aspect-ratio { grid-area: pfp; }
.profile-character-card-description-box { grid-area: desc; }
.pp-cc-tags { grid-area: tags; }
```

**Label a card by its tag.** Every tag on a bot becomes a class, so a card can
be labelled with the series it belongs to — this is how the crypt could stamp
each vessel with its world:

```css
.profile-character-card-stack::after { content: 'standalone'; grid-area: serie; }
.pp-cc-wrapper:has(.pp-tag-losttales) .profile-character-card-stack::after {
  content: 'THE LOST TALES';
}
```

**Rename a tag** the same way — zero the text, draw your own:

```css
.pp-cc-tags-regular.pp-tag-deaddove { font-size: 0; }
.pp-cc-tags-regular.pp-tag-deaddove::before { content: "Dead Dove"; font-size: .75rem; }
```

## The page furniture

| Selector | What it is |
|---|---|
| `.pp-page-background` | the page's backdrop layer |
| `.pp-top-bar`, `.pp-top-bar-left`, `.pp-top-bar-right` | the site header |
| `.glow-logo h2`, `.glow-logo p` | **the JanitorAI wordmark** — zero and redraw |
| `.pp-top-bar-search-input`, `#search-input` | site search |
| `.pp-top-bar-app-menu-list-item` | the account dropdown |
| `.pp-mnb-wrapper` | mobile nav bar |
| `.pp-uc-title` | your username |
| `.pp-uc-followers-count` | follower count |
| `.pp-uc-avatar-container`, `.pp-uc-member-since` | avatar, join date |
| `.profile-badges`, `.profile-badge` | the site-awarded badges |
| `#profile-tabs::before` | **the heading above your bot list** — "296 laments" lives here |
| `.pp-tabs-button`, `.pp-tabs-indicator` | the tab strip, usually hidden |
| `.pp-pg-total p`, `.Btn2-purple strong` | the character count |
| `.pp-fl-search-input`, `.pp-fl-filter-button` | the profile's own search and filter |
| `.pp-pg-page-button` | pagination numbers |

## Exclusive accordions

`<details name="...">` — same name on several, and opening one closes the rest.
Native, no script. Worth knowing for the crypt: the thirteen seals currently all
open independently, which is fine, but a tab strip wants this instead.

```html
<details name="profile-tabs" open><summary>About</summary>…</details>
<details name="profile-tabs"><summary>Rules</summary>…</details>
```

## The trick worth knowing

```css
.pp-uc-about-me { display: contents; }
```

`display: contents` removes the About Me box from the layout while keeping its
children. Those children then become direct items of the profile grid above
them, so a paste can lay out the *whole page* — cover image, sidebar, dropdown
column, creators panel — instead of being trapped inside one bio card.

That is the mechanism behind every paid theme with a sidebar or a two-column
bio. Combine it with a grid on the parent:

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  .profile-info-stack:first-child {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: minmax(300px, 900px) minmax(300px, 900px);
    grid-template-areas:
      "cover  cover"
      "left   right"
      ".      follow";
  }
}
```

Each child then claims its cell with `grid-area: cover`, and so on.

## Other techniques observed

**Replace the username with display type** — zero out the real text, draw your
own in a pseudo-element:

```css
.pp-uc-title { font-size: 0; }
.pp-uc-title::after { content: 'BELOVED ANGEL'; font-size: clamp(4rem, 6vw, 6rem); }
```

**Horizontal scroll row** — for THE WORLDS and the devotion groups:

```css
.row   { display: flex; gap: 20px; overflow-x: auto; }
.card  { width: 300px; flex-shrink: 0; scroll-snap-align: start; }
```

**Stack bio above the bot cards** — `.profile-page-flex { flex-direction: column; }`

**Unrestrict the bio card's width** — `.pp-uc-background { max-width: unset; }`

## Observed on live profiles

Things seen working on real pages (Hime's *Carnal Archive*, Neri's *Come in,
Angel*, *Noli Timere Messorem*, *Circus Troupe*) that go past the bio box:

**The site's own wordmark can be replaced.** Top-left reads "Carnal Archive" or
"Come in, Angel" instead of JanitorAI. Same `font-size: 0` + `::after { content }`
move as the username.

**So can the counts and placeholders.** "296 laments", "15 reaped souls",
"2360 together, under the snowfield" in place of the follower count; "search
lament…", "Do not fear the reaper" in place of the search placeholder. Anything
rendered as text can be zeroed and redrawn.

**Sticky bottom bar** — *Noli Timere* pins a strip along the foot of the page
carrying a label and the search field. `position: fixed; bottom: 0`.

**Frosted glass** — *Come in, Angel* floats near-transparent panels over a
full-bleed background with `backdrop-filter: blur()`, which suits a misty
palette far better than solid fills.

**Full-bleed background behind everything**, header included — not just behind
the bio. Our `profile-css-lean.txt` already does this on `body`.

**A portrait row overlapping the hero** — five character plates centred beneath
the display name, breaking the boundary between cover and content.

**Left sidebar** — *Circus Troupe* puts avatar, follow button, stats and a
stacked nav column down the left, cards to the right. Grid areas on
`.profile-info-stack`, same mechanism as above.

Every one of these is reachable from a single About Me paste.

## What survives the sanitizer

| | |
|---|---|
| `<style>` blocks in About Me | ✅ works — the bought themes ship four in one paste |
| `<details>` / `<summary>` | ✅ works — the crypt's seals rely on it |
| `::before` / `::after` with `content:` | ✅ works |
| `@media` queries | ✅ works |
| Inline `style=""` | ✅ always works |
| `<iframe>` | ❌ stripped — killed the SoundCloud player |
| `<script>` | ❌ stripped |

Because `<style>` works in About Me, the CSS Editor is optional. One paste into
About Me can carry both the styling and the content.

## Image hosting

GitHub Pages works (`belovedangel02.github.io/darts-of-doom/...`) and is what
the crypt uses. Community templates lean on `imgur.com` and `file.garden`.
Any of them is fine as long as the URL points straight at the image file.
